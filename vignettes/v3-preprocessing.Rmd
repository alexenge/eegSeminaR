> *Learning to use the R package `eegUtils` for loading, viewing, and cleaning EEG data so that it can be used for event-related potential (ERP) analysis.*

## 3.1 Intro: Recipes

-   Data analysis is like cooking: We take raw ingredients (data) and transform them according to a semi-standardized procedure into a tasty meal (an academic paper or thesis)

-   Every step in the recipe affords "researchers degrees of freedom" -- problematic if undisclosed[^1]

## 3.2 Loading data

-   First load required packages:

    -   `here` for working with file paths

    -   `eegUtils`[^3] for working with EEG data

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(here)
library(eegUtils)
```

-   Downloaded ERP CORE data is in `data/n170` (see Section 2.5)

-   Data is in BIDS format; each subject has it's own `sub-XXX/eeg` sub-directory

-   We need to find the `.set` file for loading the EEG data:

```{r}
bids_dir <- here("data/n170")
set_file <- here(bids_dir, "sub-001/eeg/sub-001_task-N170_eeg.set")
file.exists(set_file)
```

-   `eegUtils` has functions for loading ("importing") raw EEG data from various file formats into R, including the `.set` format used by ERP CORE

```{r}
(dat_raw <- import_set(set_file))
```

-   See what type of data we've got:

```{r}
class(dat_raw)
```

-   `eeg_data` is a custom class defined by `eegUtils` -- a big list with many sub-components:

```{r}
str(dat_raw)
```

-   The **actual EEG data** are in a data frame called `signals`

    -   Each **row** is one **sample** (time point)[^4]

    -   Each **column** is one **channel** (EEG electrode)

    -   Each **value** is the **EEG voltage** (in microvolts; µV) measured at this time sample and channel

-   Other elements contain useful **meta-information**, some of which used in later sections

[^3]: Craddock, M. (2022). *eegUtils: Utilities for electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis* (0.7.0). <https://craddm.github.io/eegUtils>

[^4]: Technically, the EEG gets recorded by the EEG electrodes in a *continuous* (analog) fashion. The *discrete* time steps that we're dealing with here were created by the EEG amplifier during the *digitization* step of the online EEG recording.

## 3.3 Viewing data

-   Usually a good idea to **visually check the data** at the outset of data analysis and at multiple steps throughout

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
browse_data(dat_raw)
```

-   Check out multiple time points ("Display start time") and switch between the "Individual" view and the "Butterfly"
-   Remember to click "Done" or you will not be able run the next piece of code

> ✍️ **EXERCISE**
>
> *Inspect the data at different time points and channels. Note down any features of data you find interesting and potentially relevant to deal with in our analysis.*

-   Static "butterfly" plot of a chunk of data:

```{r, message=FALSE}
time_lim <- c(300, 305)
plot_butterfly(dat_raw, time_lim, baseline = time_lim)
```

## 3.4 Channel locations

-   For some steps (e.g., making topographic plots) we need to know the **relative positions of electrodes** on the scalp

-   Sometimes included in the raw data, but here we need to use a separate function[^5]

```{r}
dat_raw <- electrode_locations(dat_raw, montage = "biosemi64", overwrite = TRUE)
dat_raw$chan_info
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
plot_electrodes(dat_raw, interact = TRUE)
```

[^5]: The `"biosemi64"` locations are provided by `eegUtils`, but we could also have used the `electrodes.tsv` file from the BIDS structure.

## 3.5 Re-referencing

-   During recording ("online"), each electrode is measuring the *difference* in voltage compared to the reference electrode (e.g., FCz)

-   During preprocessing ("offline"), we typically choose a new reference:

    -   **Average reference**: Difference to the average of all scalp channels

    -   **Linked mastoids**: Difference to the average of the mastoid channels (M1 and M2)

***Figure:** Different reference schemes.*[^6]

```{r}
eog_channels <- c("HEOG_left", "HEOG_right", "VEOG_lower")
dat_reref <- eeg_reference(dat_raw, ref_chans = "average", exclude = eog_channels)
```

## 3.6 Filtering

-   Insight by **Joseph Fourier** (1768--1830): Every complex signal can be described by a sum of sine waves
    -   The **frequency** (in Hz) of a sine wave describes how fast it repeats itself

![](images/fourier.png){width="600"}

***Figure:** Summing up of sine waves in the time and frequency domains.*[^7]

-   The EEG too consists of different types of activity with different frequencies:

| Frequency         | EEG activity                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| \< 0.1 Hz         | Electrode drift, sweat artifacts |
| 0.1--4 Hz (delta) | Slow-wave sleep                  |
| 4--8 Hz (theta)   | Drowsiness, idling               |
| 8--13 Hz (alpha)  | Relaxing, inhibition             |
| 13--30 Hz (beta)  | Active thinking, alertness       |
| 30--80 Hz (gamma) | Binding, consciousness (?)       |
| 50 Hz (US: 60 Hz) | Power line noise                 |
| \> 80 Hz          | Muscle artifacts                 |

-   Most brain activity detectable with EEG happens between 0.1--30 Hz

-   **Filtering** is used to remove unwanted parts of the signal:

    1.  Convert time-domain EEG into the frequency domain (Fourier transform)
    2.  Remove (resp. attenuate) certain frequencies
        -   A *high-pass* filter remove slow frequencies (e.g., \< 0.1 Hz)

        -   A *low-pass* filter removes fast frequencies (e.g., \> 30 Hz)

        -   A *band-pass* filter combines a high-pass and low-pass filter

        -   A *band-stop* filter removes a narrow frequency range (e.g., around 50 Hz)
    3.  Convert "cleaned" signal back into the time domain

```{r}
dat_filt <- eeg_filter(dat_reref, low_freq = 0.1, high_freq = 30.0)
plot_butterfly(dat_filt, time_lim, baseline = time_lim)
```

> ✍️ **EXERCISE**
>
> *Use the data browser and compare the filtered data with the raw data at a certain time point. Repeat the filtering step but making one of the two cutoff frequencies more aggressive (that is, make either the lower cutoff frequency higher or the higher cutoff frequency lower). What advantages and disadvantages could this have?*

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
...
```

> <summary>💡 **NOTE: There's a lot more to filters**</summary>
>
> *While the idea of and the code for filtering looks simple, it is actually a huge topic of research and debate. There are many different types of filters and each of them has many more parameters than just their cutoff frequency (e.g., filter length, transition bandwidth, delay, direction).*
>
> *Each of these parameters should be chosen such that the filter (a) removes as much of the unwanted signals as possible while (b) not distorting the part of the signal that we do care about. For example, it has been shown that using a low-pass filter with too high a cutoff (e.g., 1 Hz instead of 0.1 Hz) can introduce artificial "bumps" in the data that can be mistaken for true ERP components.*[^8]

-   Let's save our preprocessed (re-referenced and filtered) data for the next step[^9]

```{r, warning=FALSE}
deriv_dir <- here(bids_dir, "derivatives/eegUtils/sub-001/eeg")
preproc_file <- here(deriv_dir, "sub-001_task-N170_desc-preprocessed_eeg.rds")
dir.create(deriv_dir, recursive = TRUE)
saveRDS(dat_filt, preproc_file)
```

[^9]: There's not yet a final standard for the organization of BIDS derivatives, that is, for processed outputs produced from BIDS data. Here we'll loosely follow the BIDS conventions (e.g., using a subject-specific `eeg` folder), but we'll also cut some corners (e.g., not creating `.json` metadata) to save time.

## Add-on topics

### 3.7 Downsampling

-   The **sampling rate** defines the number of EEG voltages recorded per second (= Hertz)

```{r}
dat_raw$srate
```

-   This means that each pair of samples is less than 1 ms apart!

```{r}
1 / dat_raw$srate
```

-   We typically don't need *that* much temporal resolution,[^10] so it is often useful to **downsample** the data

```{r}
dat_downs <- eeg_downsample(dat_filt, q = 4.0) # q is the downsampling factor
```

-   This reduces our computer's memory load and will make subsequent computations faster

```{r}
show_size_mb <- function(x) format(object.size(x), units = "MB")
lapply(list(before = dat_filt, after = dat_downs), show_size_mb)
```

```{r}
saveRDS(dat_downs, preproc_file)
```

***Figure:** Moderate downsampling typically doesn't affect future plots or statistical results.*[^11]

[^10]: This is because both the *cognitive processes* that we are interested in (e.g., perception, language, memory) and the *biological processes* that we detect with the EEG (mostly post-synaptic potentials) unfold on the orders of 10--100 ms rather than 1 ms.
