## 2.1 Research we can trust

***Figure 2.1a** The replication crisis in psychology.*[^1]

-   We want (psychological) research findings to be trustworthy

-   At the very least, other researchers that repeat an experiment or analysis should be able to get the same results

***Figure:** Terminology for trustworthy research.*[^2]

-   Sharing research data helps to establish **reproducibility** and **robustness**

-   Pre-registering one's analysis and sharing materials and protocols helps to establish **replicability** and **generalizability**

## 2.3 Standardizing data

-   **Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS)** = a standardized way of organizing neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, EEG) data for easier sharing and reuse

![](images/bids.png "Example EEG dataset in BIDS format. Source: Scientific Data")

***Figure:** Example EEG dataset in BIDS format.*[^3]

-   Folders organized by subjects (`sub-001/`, `sub-002/`, etc.), session (`ses-01`, `ses-02`, etc., if applicable) and imaging modality (`T1w` -- structural MRI, `func` -- functional MRI, `eeg` -- EEG recordings, etc.)

-   Raw data files (e.g., `.set`/`.fdt` for EEG) are accompanied by metadata (e.g., in `.json` format)

    -   Meta-data contains info about the task, the scanner, etc.

-   Additional dataset-wide files like `dataset_description.json`, `participants.tsv`, `README`

## 2.4 ERP CORE dataset

-   **ERP Compendium of Open Resources and Experiments (ERP CORE)**[^4] = an open dataset with data from six different EEG experiments

-   Each experiment was optimally designed to elicit a certain ERP component (more on that later)

![](images/erp_core_tasks.jpg){width="400"}

***Figure:** Tasks in the ERP CORE dataset.*[^5]

-   Each experiment completed by the same 40 participants (25 female, 15 male, age 21.5 ± 2.9 years)

-   30 EEG electrodes (10/20 system) + 3 EOG electrodes (eye movements)

-   Sampling rate (= number of recorded EEG voltages per second) of 1024 Hz

## 2.5 Downloading data

-   Manually from the Open Science Framework (<https://osf.io/thsqg/>) or using the R package `erpcore`[^6]

-   Start by creating an empty data directory

    -   `here()` function from the `here` package to create *relative* file paths (hence reproducible on different machines and operating systems)

```{r}
(data_dir <- here::here("data/n170"))
dir.create(data_dir, recursive = TRUE)
```

-   Then actually download the ERP CORE data

    -   `"n170"` to get only the data from the face percetion (N170) experiment

    -   `"bids"` type to get data in BIDS format

    -   Only download the first of the 40 subjects for now

```{r, message=FALSE}
erpcore::get_erpcore(
  component = "n170",
  dest_path = data_dir,
  type = "bids",
  subjects = "sub-001"
)
```

> ✍️ **EXERCISE**
>
> *Open the `data/n170` directory in the file explorer and take a look at the different files that were downloaded. Can you figure out the purpose for all of them?*

## Add-on topics

### 2.6 Version control

-   For full transparency and reproducibility, we need to share not just our data but also our code

-   Ideally not just the final version (e.g., upload script on OSF), but the full history

-   Also helpful for your future self to understand what you did 6 months ago

-   **Version control** tools like git are very powerful for this:

    1.  Make your project folder a git repository

    2.  Write/edit code

    3.  Take a snapshot ("commit") of the code if you're happy with it

    4.  Include a helpful commit message for your future self or collaborators

    5.  Try out new stuff while always being able to revert to any previous commit
